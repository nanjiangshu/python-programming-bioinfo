    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>After the lectures and exercises, you will have the opportunity to work on a course project. The project is designed to allow you to think more freely using the knowledge you have acquired, along with the tools we have covered during the lectures. It is a simple example of a problem you might encounter during your own research and is intended to prepare you to use Python to solve such problems.</p>

    <p>Please note that the project is not mandatory, and completing the course does not depend on its completion. However, we highly recommend that you attempt to solve the tasks and encourage you to ask questions if something is unclear. Since some of you might not have the time to complete the project during the course hours, we will be expecting questions regarding the project during the week following the course completion. </p>

    <p>The presentation can be found in the <a href="lectures/Day_2.slides.embedded.html" target="_blank">lecture for Day 2</a>.</p>


    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>For many diseases with known causative mutations, screening methods have been developed to detect whether people have a high risk of becoming sick, even before the onset of the actual disease. Over the last few years, the cost of full genome sequencing has gone down so that, in some cases, it might be cheaper to collect the complete genome sequence of patients with a high risk of carrying variants associated with the disease, rather than using targeted screening procedures.</p>

    <p>Cystic fibrosis is a complex disease, where patients often manifest the following symptoms: problems with lung functions, diabetes and infertility. From a genetic point of view, there are several mutations associated with this disease. The gene CFTR (short for Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) encodes an ion channel protein acting in epithelial cells and is encoded on chromosome 7 of the human genome. CFTR carries several non-synonymous genetic variants, some of which leading to premature stop codons that are known to cause the disease.</p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>In this assignment, you have access to the human reference genome (chromosome 7) as well as the full genome annotation. In addition, you have genome sequence data of chromosome 7 from five individuals from a family at risk of carrying mutations related to the disease.</p>
    <p>Your task is to write a Python program that:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>extracts a disease-causing transcript from the CFTR gene,</li>
        <li>translates the gene sequence to its corresponding amino-acid sequence, and</li>
        <li>based on the reference amino-acid sequence determine whether any of the five given individuals is affected.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Required Material</h2>
    <p>The main task is divided into several steps. The first step is to download the <a href="assignment/data.zip">data.zip</a> which includes
    <table class="filetable">
        <tr>
            <th>Filename</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.93.gtf.gz</td>
            <td>Human reference annotation file (GTF format)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.chromosome.7.fa.gz</td>
            <td>Human reference DNA sequence for chromosome 7 (fasta format)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Patient1.fa.gz</td>
            <td>DNA sequence data for Patient 1 (fasta format)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Patient2.fa.gz</td>
            <td>DNA sequence data for Patient 2 (fasta format)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Patient3.fa.gz</td>
            <td>DNA sequence data for Patient 3 (fasta format)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Patient4.fa.gz</td>
            <td>DNA sequence data for Patient 4 (fasta format)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Patient5.fa.gz</td>
            <td>DNA sequence data for Patient 5 (fasta format)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>gtf-format.md</td>
            <td>Markdown file explaining the GTF format</td>
        </tr>
    </table>



    <p>If you are not familiar with the file formats, read up online on how the files are structured. For example, <a href="assignment/data/gtf-format.md" target="_blank">here</a> you can find a short description of the different (tab-delimited) fields of a GTF file and <a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=BlastHelp" target="_blank">here</a> a general description about the fasta files.</p>
    <p>Some of the tasks involve outputting long sequences. To make sure they are correct, use the <code>utils.check_answers</code> package (from the <a href="downloads" target="_blank">downloads folder</a>). You can import it that way:</p>
    <pre><code>from utils import check_answers</code></pre>
    <p>More detailed instructions are given with each task that uses the package.</p>

    <h2>Warm-up</h2>
    <p>We recommend creating a folder in your file system, called <b>project</b>. In this folder you can add all the required files, such as the reference and annotation files, as well as the downloaded folder from the previous step.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Unzip the reference DNA and annotation files (fasta and GTF respectively), so that you can check their contents. That should be possible using 7zip in Windows and double clicking the files in MacOS and Linux.</li>
        <li>Now that the files are decompressed, you can check their content using the <code>head</code> command on your terminal. You can search online how to use the <code>head</code> command or type <code>head --help</code> to see the usage instructions. You can check the first two lines of each file using the <code>head</code> command.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Find the Patients at Risk</h2>
    <p>We are reaching the goal for this assignment!</p>
    <p>A mutation in the transcript ENST00000003084 causes a premature stop codon to be introduced into the amino acid sequence. This creates a truncated protein, causing cystic fibrosis. Use the python code you have written to solve the tasks above and extend it to compare the reference genome sequence of chromosome 7 to the sequences of the following 5 patients in fasta format (Patient1.fa.gz, Patient2.fa.gz, Patient3.fa.gz, Patient4.fa.gz, and Patient5.fa.gz) to determine which of them are carrying a mutation in the CFTR gene that causes a truncated protein.</p>

    <h2>Extra Task</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use BioPython to parse the fasta file and to translate DNA nucleotides into amino acids.</li>
