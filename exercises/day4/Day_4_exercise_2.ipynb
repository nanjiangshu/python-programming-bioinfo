    "## 1.  Create a module from previouse exercises and use it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "A Python module is a file containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) which you can import and use in other Python scripts. This allows for better organization and reusability of your code. You import a module using the import statement.\n",
    "- __Note__: `class` is out of scope for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Save functions to a module\n",
    "- Save the functions you created from `Day 3, Exercise 2` (calculating the length of sequences and GC content) into a file called `dnatools.py` \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add Documentation\n",
    "- Add module-level documentation (a docstring at the beginning of the file) describing what the module is about.\n",
    "- For each function, write a help message (a docstring directly under the function definition line, starting with def).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Testing the module \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the module \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Show the help message of the module `dnatools`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Show the help message of the function `get_seqlength`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Write a test script called `test_dnatools.py` that tests the functions `get_seqlength`, `read_seq` and `get_gc_content` using the sequence file `one_dna_sequence.fa`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a Python script called `./cal_seqlen_3.py` that perform the same functionality as the script `./cal_seqlen_2.py` you created at the `Bonus task of Day3, Exercise2` (copy the code from the answers if you haven't done it yet). However, this time you will use the function imported from the module `dnatools`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try different ways to import the function from the module, e.g., \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dnatools import get_seqlength\n",
    "# Import only the function get_seqlength from the module dnatools\n",
    "# The function can be called directly as get_seqlength(seqfile)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import dnatools\n",
    "# Import the whole module under the namespace dnatools.\n",
    "# The function can be called by dnatools.get_seqlength(seqfile)\n",
    "# This approach can be slower and take more memory if the module is large.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from dnatools import *\n",
    "# Import all functions and variables from the module dnatools.\n",
    "# All functions and variables can be used directly in the script.\n",
    "# This approach can be less efficient and make the code harder to debug if the module is large.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips:\n",
    "- You don't need to add `#!/usr/bin/env python` at the beginning of the moudle file since this python script is not supposed to be execuated directlly in the command line \n",

    "Biopython is a collection of Python libraries and tools designed to facilitate biological computations. It provides functionalities for reading and writing different sequence formats, working with sequence alignments, performing various biological computations, and interfacing with popular bioinformatics databases and tools.
